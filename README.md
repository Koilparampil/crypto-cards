# crypto-cards

## Project Description
Through this app, you can look up a Pokémon card and see how much of a certain cryptocurrency you can get for it. Build a personalized deck of cards. It can be cards you physically own, or a collection you would like to buy. A total value of your deck will be provided, like a card portfolio!
